# Cub3D

## Overview

**Cub3D** is an introduction to the world of 3D programming in C.
The project focuses on understanding raycasting, handling 2D and 3D graphics,
and working with textures and sprites. The main goal is to create a simple 3D game where the player can navigate a maze.

## Features

- **Raycast Engine**: Implements a basic raycasting algorithm to render 3D graphics from a 2D map.
- **Texture Mapping**: Adds textures to walls for a more realistic appearance.
- **User Interaction**: Allows basic movement and interaction within the game world.

1. **Clone the repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Joaofcpereira8/Cub3d.git
  ```
